# 3D Wave Generator

There is an example available on [rickbross.com](http://rickbross.com/wave/)

To run this demo, in your Terminal:

1. `cd` into your `/3d-wave-generator` directory
2. Install the npm packages with `npm install`
3. Produce a build with `grunt`. A server will automatically open the app in your browser.

After you have made a build, you can open `/3d-wave-generator/dist/index.html` at any time to start the demo.
